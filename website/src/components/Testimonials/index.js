              The best 3D software, it has it all. Blender became the one for all solution that is also the best compared to every competitor. Most of the media companies we consulted were using other software, or even software suites, that were replaced by Blender, gaining so much more productivity and better results.

              The Future of 3D Made Easy. We use Blender in our marketing agency to create product launch images, 3D animations for the beginnings of Youtube and Tiktok videos, as well as for the creation of any other product images our clients may need. Occasionally we also use it for the creation of 3D logos and logo animations to present to clients.

              Blender - An easy tool to start creating your dream 3d world with animations. We at Techno NJR believes in making students future ready by introducing them with the augmented and virtual reality applications. For creating a virtual environment we first need to make a 3d model and animations of it and then we take it into Unity or Unreal Engine to generate final environment with interactions. For creating various 3d models with animations, we were in need of a 3D Design software. Previously we were using Autodesk 3ds max, but due to its high requirement of processing power and high cost, we started looking for a faster and cheaper alternative and that's when BLENDER came into the picture.

              Blender is the best. Blender is free , open source 3D creation suite that has so many features that allows you to model animate, video editing and even simulate some projects during composition . I can say its is all in one package , It does supports Linux, Windows and Mac operating system . If you are looking for a free accessible complete set of tool to start 3D modeling, digital sculpting , I think Blender is the one for you.
